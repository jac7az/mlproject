        "Our dataset is about murders throughout the U.S. The dataset spans from 1976 to 2023, but for the purposes of this project we will be focusing on data from after the year 2010. This subset the data to a more manageable range. In the original dataset, there were some columns that were dropped due to them not being relevant, such as the filedata or the MSA. The columns in the current data set are:\n",
        "- State - The state of the Crime.\n",
        "- Agency - The city of the Crime.\n",
        "- Source - Where this data came from (i.e. the FBI)\n",
        "- Solved - Was the case solved?\n",
        "- Year - Year of Crime.\n",
        "- Month - Month of Crime.\n",
        "- Homicide - Type of Crime.\n",
        "- Situation - Situation in which the crime occurred.\n",
        "- VicAge - Age of Victim.\n",
        "- VicSex - Sex of Victim.\n",
        "- VicRace - Race of Victim.\n",
        "- VicEthnic - Ethnicity of Victim.\n",
        "- OffAge - Age of Offender.\n",
        "- OffSex - Sex of Offender.\n",
        "- OffRace - Race of Offender.\n",
        "- OffEthnic - Ethnicity of Offender.\n",
        "- Weapon - Weapon Used.\n",
        "- Relationship - Relationship between Victim and Offender.\n",
        "- Circumstance - Situation of Crime.\n",
        "- VicCount - Amount of Victims.\n",
        "- OffCount - Amount of Offenders.\n",
