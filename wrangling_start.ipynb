This subset the data to a more manageable range. In the original dataset, there were some columns that were dropped due to them not being relevant, such as the filedata or the MSA. The columns in the current data set are:\n",

        "- Month - Month of Crime.\n",
        "- Homicide - Type of Crime.\n",
        "- Situation - Situation in which the crime occurred.\n",
